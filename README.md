#### Introduction to application

I chose the palindrome exercise to demonstrate the tests that I thought about this, and then I am going to improve this script over the defects reported by myself.

#### Dataset for testing

This is the dataset that I use to test the app:

> Name now one man
> Never odd or even
> God save Eva's dog
> No lemon, no melon
> No, it is opposition
> Stella won no wallets
> This phrase is not a palindrome
> The last Test
